Uh oh, it doesn't look like you added a label to your repository. Labels enable you to identify the purpose behind a specific issue or pull request _and_ also let contributors find your project. 

Some example labels that might be useful for your project include:

- `documentation needed` or `docs needed`
- `first-timer`
- `outside of scope`
- your next upcoming release number
