Adding topics to a repository is a great start, but there are more ways to make your repository easier for the community to find your open source project. The open source community uses **labels** to help identify issues and pull requests that are looking for contributions from newcomers to the open source scene.

Labels enable you to identify what a specific issue or pull request is trying to accomplish. By default, a new GitHub repository comes with the following labels out of the box:

- bug
- duplicate
- enhancement
- help wanted
- invalid
- question
- wontfix

These initial labels are an awesome way of identifying your issues and pull requests, however, you can add (or delete) labels to not only identify the focus of the issue or pull request but also make it easier for people to find your issues and pull requests. If you find yourself struggling with a task or want to make it easier for someone to contribute to your project, using specific labels will accomplish this goal.

Labels can be customized with a unique name, a description to identify what the label should be used for, and an awesome color! Labels like `first-timers-only` make it easy for newcomers to open source to find issues and pull requests in your project that need some help but are also welcoming and supportive to new open source contributors.
