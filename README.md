### About this course

This course reviews the protected branches and webhooks functionality of your repository.

Repository Community Starter Kit

Hosting a project on GitHub enables you to share your work with millions of other developers :tada:. Having a huge community to help make your dreams become a reality by contributing to your project is a great thing, however, as a repository owner you have the responsiblity of making your project easy to find for other users. 

This course will walk you through the different items you can add to your repository to welcome new contributors and make it easier for them to report issues, suggest new features, or potentially submit a pull request! 

This course has everything you'll need to help create an environment so that the public want to work with you. Install this on existing repo, or start from scratch. 

Bonus: We can link this course directly to a repo's Community Profile
