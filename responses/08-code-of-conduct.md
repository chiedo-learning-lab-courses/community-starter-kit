## Step 13: Add the Code of Conduct

Having a Code of Conduct is really important. Instead of re-writing the wheel, Mona wants to adopt the **Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct**.

Can you help her grab the markdown version from [the contributor covenant website](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and paste it in to the empty file in this pull request?
