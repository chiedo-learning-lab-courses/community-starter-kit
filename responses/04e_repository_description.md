Uh oh, it doesn't look like you havw edited the repository description. If you are trying to figure out how to describe your project, here are some ideas:

- Describe what your project does
- If this is your first repository, you could use: "My first GitHub repository"
- If this is an open source project, perhaps identify that it is an open source repository
