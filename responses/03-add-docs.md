## Step 4: Create user documentation

Well written user documentation is the key to a great user experience. Experts say, "if a user can't figure out how to use your project in less than an hour, they will move on." It pays to attract a few technical writers to your project. :wink:

 ### Where to create documentation

 Your user documentation should be easy for your users to find. Some prefer to keep it on an externally facing website while others will use a docs folder in their project or the repository wiki.

 #### Getting organized

 As an open source project becomes more popular and more sophisticated, some maintainers find it is easier to move their open source project into an a GitHub organization. This allows you to create separate repositories for your project's promotional website, documentation, source code, etc.

### What to include

Documentation needs for open source projects will vary, but at a minimum you should include:

- [ ] Installation instructions
- [ ] Completing essential tasks
- [ ] Customizing and configuring

Will you help Mona ensure the documentation covers these minimum topics?
