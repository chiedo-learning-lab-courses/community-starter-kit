After implementing the different tools to make your project more friendly to the open source community, it is time to throw down the welcome mat. In this section, we will look at ways to promote your project.

### Pointer Projects

The open source community has a handful of projects that help guide newcomers to open source projects that need a helping hand :hand:. Projects like [Your First PR](http://yourfirstpr.github.io/), [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/), [Awesome for non-programmers](https://github.com/szabgab/awesome-for-non-programmers), [Awesome for Beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/) and [First Contributions](https://roshanjossey.github.io/first-contributions/) enable you to get your project noticed by individuals looking to get into the world of open source. 

You promote your project using the automatically by using the [First Timers](https://github.com/apps/first-timers) app that creates issues that walk a newcomer through the change you need. By making it easier for someone to make their first contribution to your project you are potentially helping create a consistent contributor.
