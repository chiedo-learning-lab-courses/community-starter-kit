## Step 9: Add topics

Your GitHub project can be assigned topics to make it easier for people to find it.

For instance, if we look at the topics assigned to the `first-timer-bot` repository by `hoodiehq` we can identify things like: community, first-timers-only, bot, probot-app, and probot.

That means that people looking for any of those keywords are more apt to find their repository.

### :keyboard: Activity: Adding Topics to your Repository

As a first step to making your GitHub repository easier to find for potential contributors you are going to add topics to your project.

1. On the **Code** tab, click the **Add topics** option.
1. In the **Topics** field, enter your first topic. GitHub might have some **Suggested** topics for your repository.
1. After entering a topic (or topics), click **Done**.

Once you have finished adding at least one topic to your repository, you can close this issue. I'll open a new issue providing the next steps.

### Pointer Projects

The open source community has a handful of projects that help guide newcomers to open source projects that need a helping hand :hand:. Projects like [Your First PR](http://yourfirstpr.github.io/), [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/), [Awesome for non-programmers](https://github.com/szabgab/awesome-for-non-programmers), [Awesome for Beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/) and [First Contributions](https://roshanjossey.github.io/first-contributions/) enable you to get your project noticed by individuals looking to get into the world of open source.

You promote your project using the automatically by using the [First Timers](https://github.com/apps/first-timers) app that creates issues that walk a newcomer through the change you need. By making it easier for someone to make their first contribution to your project you are potentially helping create a consistent contributor.
