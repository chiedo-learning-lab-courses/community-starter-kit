## Welcome to the community starter kit

Meet Mona.

Mona is part of a busy team of developers that is in the process of adding some new developers to the team. To help welcome these new teammates, she has created a cool new Probot app that automatically generates messages when they create their first issue, pull request, and merge their first pull request. 

So far, she has been working with a few members of her team to fine-tune the app, but one of her co-workers recommended that she make the project open source. Mona has never published an open source project before, so after receiving the OK from her legal team, she is looking for someone to help her out.

In this course, you will help Mona get her repository ready for her open source community.

### What is Probot

Great question! [Probot](https://probot.github.io/) is an open source framework that allows you to create GitHub apps to automate your GitHub workflow. Probot is also an example of a great community - be sure to stop by and check them out.

### Our Goals

In this course, you will work with Mona to:

- Help others understand how they can use Mona's project
- Recognize the ways people may contribute
- Establish systems to organize contributions
- Set expectations for contributors
- Make Mona's project easy to find
