## Welcome to the community starter kit

Meet Mona. Mona has created a cool new Probot app that does XXXXXXXX. So far, she has been working alone and building the app to meet the needs of her team. One of her co-workers recommended that she consider making the project open source. Mona has never published an open source project before, so she is looking for someone to help her out.

In this course, you will help Mona get her repository ready for her open source community.

### What is Probot

Great question! [Probot](https://probot.github.io/) is an open source framework that allows you to create GitHub apps to automate your GitHub workflow.

### Our Goals

In this course, you will work with Mona to:

- Help others understand how they can use Mona's project
- Recognize the ways people may contribute
- Establish systems to organize contributions
- Set expectations for contributors
- Make Mona's project easy to find
