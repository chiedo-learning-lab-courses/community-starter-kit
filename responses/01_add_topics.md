Your GitHub project can be assigned topics to make it easier for people to find it. 

For instance, if we look at the topics assigned to the `first-timer-bot` repository by `hoodiehq` we can identify things like: community, first-timers-only, bot, probot-app, and probot.

That means that people looking for any of those keywords are more apt to find their repository. 

### :keyboard: Activity: Adding Topics to your Repository

As a first step to making your GitHub repository easier to find for potential contributors you are going to add topics to your project.

1. On the **Code** tab, click the **Add topics** option.
1. In the **Topics** field, enter your first topic. GitHub might have some **Suggested** topics for your repository.
1. After entering a topic (or topics), click **Done**.

Once you have finished adding at least one topic to your repository, you can close this issue. I'll open a new issue providing the next steps.
