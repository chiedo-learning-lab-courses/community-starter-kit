## Understanding contributors

The path that most contributors take to opening their first pull request on a repository typically looks like:

- Create an isssue reporting a bug
- Create an issue requesting a new feature
- Create a pull request making a change to the repository

More seasoned contributors might bypass some of those steps before creating their first pull request, but you can add helpful templates to a repository that makes it easier for _everyone_ to get involved no matter their previous experience with contributing to open source projects. 

## Step 4: Adding issue templates

When you add an issue template and pull request template to your repository, project contributors will automatically see the template's contents when they open a new issue or pull request. Templates help you standardize the information you'd like included when contributors open issues.

### Creating multiple templates

In Open Source projects, templates make it easy for new contributors to create a bug reports, suggest new features, or contribute changes. Mona has already created an issue template for new, can you put one together for bugs?
