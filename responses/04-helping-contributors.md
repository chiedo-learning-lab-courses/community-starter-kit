## Understanding contributors

the on-ramp for a contributor typically involves bugs --> feature recommendations --> PRs
this may vary for more experienced contributors

## Step 4: Adding issue templates

When you add an issue template and pull request template to your repository, project contributors will automatically see the template's contents when they open a new issue or pull request. Templates help you standardize the information you'd like included when contributors open issues.

### Creating multiple templates

In Open Source projects, templates make it easy for new contributors to create a bug reports, suggest new features, or contribute changes. Mona has already created an issue template for new, can you put one together for bugs?
