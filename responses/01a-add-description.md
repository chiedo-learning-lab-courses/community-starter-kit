## Step 1: Add a Repository Description

First, let's focus on helping others understand Mona's project. After all, people are most likely to contribute to projects they use, so `no users === no contributors`.

Users should be able to understand the project at a glance, so let's start by adding a repository description and creating a `README.md`.

Mona is working on a first draft of the `README.md`. Can you help by adding a description to the repository?

> **Protip** If you are working in a public repository, GitHub has created a helpful [Community profile]({{ repoUrl }}/community-starter-kit/community) in the insights tab. The Community profile has helpful quick-links to complete many of the tasks in this course.
