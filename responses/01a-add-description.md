## Step 1: Add a Repository Description

First, let's focus on helping others understand Mona's project. After all, people are most likely to contribute to projects they use, so `no users === no contributors`.

You want users to understand the project at a glance, so start by adding a description and creating the README.

Mona is working on a first draft of the README. Can you help by adding a description to the repository?
