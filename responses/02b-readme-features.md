I was looking for you to replace the features placeholder, but it looks like it's still there. Marketing gave us a with a few bullets for the features (they are so good at this stuff). Here is what they recommended:

> Welcome new users with maintainer defined comments the first time your users:
> - Create a new issue
> - Open a new pull request
> - Merge their first pull request

Do you mind adding it to the `README.md` in this pull request where Mona put the placeholder?
