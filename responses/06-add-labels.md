## Step 9: Add labels

The open source community uses **labels** to help organize issues and pull requests within their repositories. They also use them to identify issues and pull requests that are looking for contributions from newcomers or to highlight specific skills needed to respond to the request.

By default, a new GitHub repository comes with the following labels out of the box:

- bug
- duplicate
- enhancement
- help wanted
- invalid
- question
- wontfix

These initial labels are awesome, but most maintainers add (or delete) labels to fit their project. Labels like `first-timers-only` make it easy for newcomers to find suitable issues and pull requests, but they also tell the world you are welcoming and supportive to new open source contributors.
