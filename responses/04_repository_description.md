## Repository Description

To make your project easy to find, there are some files and settings that we can modify. An easy way to make your project discoverable is to update the repository description to better identify what your repository is for.

#### :keyboard: Activity: Modify the Repository Description

1. Go to the **Code** tab of your repository.
TODO: Have @hectorsector show me how to link to the student's repo
1. Click the **Edit** button located on the right side of the repository. 
1. In the **Description** field, enter a useful description of your project. For example "My project" or "Javascript Forms" might be too generic, adding something like "Javascript Mailing List Forms" or what your project accomplishes (or plans to accomplish) will make it easier for people to find your project.
1. If your project has a website associated with it, perhaps a [GitHub Page](link to GitHub Pages course), you should add a link to this repository.
