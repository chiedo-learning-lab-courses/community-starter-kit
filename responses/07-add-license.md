## Step 7: Add a LICENSE

Licenses are vital in open source repositories, because they set the rules for how others are allowed to use, change, and contribute to your project. In fact, if Mona doesn't add an open source license to her project, it is not technically open source -- in that case, it could be considered copyrighted work.

Mona did a bunch of research on open source licenses (and we recommend you do too) on https://choosealicense.com/. After a quick consultation with her legal team, Mona has selected the simple and permissive MIT license.

The [Choose a license site](https://choosealicense.com/) has helpful copy/paste links you can use to grab the license text. It is strongly recommended that you do not alter the license in any way, other than filling in your project details as instructed.

Mona has already grabbed the license, can you please make sure the project details are filled in?
