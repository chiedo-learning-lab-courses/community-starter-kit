Your repository is public and you have a `README.md`! :tada:

You probably already know that a `README` file tells other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.

A `README` is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. `README` files typically include information on:

- What the project does
- Why the project is useful
- How users can get started with the project
- Where users can get help with your project
- Who maintains and contributes to the project

Go ahead and update your `README` if it's missing any of this information.
